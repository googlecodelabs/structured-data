Add structured data to your web pages
============

This codelab walks you through adding structured data to a simple HTML site, including where to place your structured data on a site and how to validate structured data. 

Introduction
------------
Google Search works hard to understand the content of a web page. You can help us by providing explicit clues about the meaning of a page with structured data. 

Structured data provides a way to standardize information about a page and classify the page content. We also use structured data to enable special search result features and enhancements. For example, a recipe page with valid structured data can be eligible to appear in a graphical search result, which we call a rich result in a host carousel.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- A recent version of Chrome or other modern web browser
- The sample code
- A text editor (This is optional. You can use the [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/) to draft your JSON-LD samples)
- Basic understanding of HTML and JSON syntax
